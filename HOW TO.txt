How did we install the virtual environment?!?

I will tell you (slightly different from lecture video):


from CMD, type python -m venv venv
(the second venv is what we are naming the virtual environment)


To activate it (start using the virtual environment):

cmd:
venv\Scripts\activate

then activate conda, as well
cmd:
conda activate
(you'll see (base) (venv) in cmd line if done correctly)

Then start installing things:
create a requirements.txt into the main project folder
copy everything from the provided requirements.txt file
cmd: pip install -r requirements.txt
(pip freeze > requirements.txt will show/check all software installed)

(the host server will look for the requirements.txt for everything needed to be installed)
